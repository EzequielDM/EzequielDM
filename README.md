# About me 🙃

My name is Ezequiel, I'm a 20yo developer.
I've been coding since I'm 12, which is when I started developing
Minecraft plugins in JAVA using Bukkit API.
Later on I started learning web development and started messing around with HTML, CSS, PHP AND JS.
I tried many things and many different languages, I have some background in C++ and Reverse Engineering too.
