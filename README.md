# About me 🙃

My name is Ezequiel, I'm a Brazilian 18yo developer situated in São Paulo.
I've been coding since I'm 12, which is when I started developing
Minecraft plugins in JAVA using Bukkit API.
Later on I started learning web development and started messing around with HTML, CSS, PHP AND JS.
I tried many things and many different languages, I have some background in Reverse Engineering too.

Now I finally found my love, the MERN stack.
